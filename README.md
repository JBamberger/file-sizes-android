# FileSizes Android

![Gradle build](https://github.com/JBamberger/file-sizes-android/workflows/Gradle%20build/badge.svg?branch=master)

This repository contains a small app which lists the file system contents of the internal memory. The app helps to find large directories and files. The project is no serious application and was hacked together quickly.
